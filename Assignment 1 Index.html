   Hello! My name is Thomas Winbush, I was born in Riverside County
   on January 23rd in 1995. I grew up in Moreno valley California most 
   of my life and also in San Bernardino. My hobbies are working out, 
   spending time with family, and riding motorcycles. As a child I was
   exposed to computers at a young age by my father, my father was a 
   Senior I.T. Technician and owned his own business for over 30 years.
   My father is my biggest role modle and has taught me everything I know 
   to this day. My father always told me that I could achieve anything in 
   this life that I put my mind to and the only person that could hinder me
   in that journey is myself.
